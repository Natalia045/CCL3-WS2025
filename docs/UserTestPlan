User Test Plan

Heuristic evaluation:

Progress ring does not clearly explain what happens when the goal is exceeded
Heuristic: #1
Severity: 4
It is not clear how to delete an added sugar entry.
Heuristic: #1, #3
Severity: 2
The close button (“X”) is placed on the right side of the top bar, which does not follow common Android navigation conventions.
Heuristic: #4
Severity: 4
Users can only view and edit sugar entries for the current day; past data is neither visible nor accessible.
Heuristic: #1, #3
Severity: 2
The app does not clearly confirm when a sugar entry has been added successfully.
Heuristic: #1
Severity: 4
Error messages are missing when incorrect or incomplete input is entered.
Heuristic: #5
Severity: 1
First-time users receive no introduction on how to use the app.
Heuristic: #10
Severity: 5
The daily goal may not be too obvious for new users.
Heuristic: #2
Severity: 5
The challenges may be not so clear on how the progress is calculated.
Heuristic: #1
Severity: 4
No help or support section is available.
Heuristic: #10
Severity: 4
There are no accessibility features.
Heuristic: #8
Severity: 2

Hypothesis:

If users are asked to remove an item, then they will fail to find a solution, because there is no visible "Delete" or "Swipe to remove" affordance.
IV: presence of a visible delete button
DV: user success rate in removing an item

If the "X" button is on the right, then users will click the top-left area first, because they expect a standard Android "Back" navigation.
IV: placement of the close action
DV: location of user click

If the visual progress ring remains at a static "100% full" and "Red" state for all values above the 50g limit, then users will experience a loss of Relative Impact Sense, because the UI no longer provides a visual delta between a minor overstep (e.g., 55g) and a major health risk (e.g., 120g).
IV: progress ring behavior above the limit
DV: risk differentiation

Test method: 

- 3 task based on hypothesis
- google form questions
- SEQ

Task 1:
Make a food entry to today's intake and then delete it.

Task 2: 
Go to the Add-Page again, then navigate back to the Home-Page.

Task 3:
Cross your daily limit and make another entry after that.
