            This has been my favorite CCL so far because of the topic. The most challenging part was learning how to work together with someone in real time, which can be really frustrating in the coding world.
            For me, the hardest part was merging the code, but I think we learned a lot from that experience.
            I also gained insight into what makes a good mobile application, realized that sometimes I need to adjust my expectations to achieve our goals, and learned a lot about using GitHub and Android Studio at the same time.

            We made sure to split the work evenly. I contributed to every part, including design, coding, brainstorming, and documentation. Overall, I think we met our goals and created a fully functioning app with a great user experience.
            Of course, there’s always room for improvement. If we had more time, I would like to add new types of challenges, track consecutive days, implement a login for a more personalized experience, and create a more precise system for awarding points through challenges.

            Even though I did not come very well prepared to this CCL (could not take away much from Mobile Coding), this was the least stressful and most enjoyable CCL so far. We could finish on time, and the end product looked and worked good. Our biggest hurdle was the first big merging issue. It was bad at the time, and requeried a longer day, but at the same time it forced us to understand the code, the architecture and git itself more.
            
            Some of the parts I worked more on were the Home page and the Add and Edit screen, and also the coding the Design ideas, so Colors (Both dark and light) and text sizes. 

            My ideas for improvement are aboout to make "adding" even more easier: e.g. open-ended input that uses AI to give back sugar amount for complex meals (e.g. "Germknödel with Vanillia sauce and an Almdudler" and it gives back 60g-s of sugar) or a barcode scanner.
